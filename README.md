- 👋 Hi, I’m @ThePicaresqueRed
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Things that do not concern mortals
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... how to curse in 47 languages as well as 3 languages not heard by human ears
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... adventures that do not involve clowns, necormancy, or a combination of the two.
- 📫 How to reach me ...Do not. Do not percieve me. Do not reference existence. 

Here are my Gnome Gnickels: https://solscan.io/token/2f9GHFLy82GmYwrcTSVWr2fnPpTigmGdHRz5fpVisAXy#holders
